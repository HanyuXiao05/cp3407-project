## Project Overview

**Project Title: JCU Gym Management System - Modern Gym Management System with MySQL database**

**Justification for the Project:**

**Why a New ICT Solution is Required?**  

This project seeks to address the limitations of the existing JCU gym management system by introducing modern features that enhance user experience for both gym users (students and staff) and administrators. The current system lacks modern infrastructure, such as secure online registration, interactive interface, and visibility features. Its processes are mostly manual, with registration requiring paper forms, session booking requiring staff intervention to generate booking IDs, and with administrators facing difficulties with tracking. Overall, there are limitations in reliability, decision-making, and efficiency. To address these challenges and improve user experience, an ICT solution is required.

**Market and ICT Technology Research:**

The fitness and recreation management industry has experienced substantial transformation through ICT integration. Modern gym management systems now incorporate features such as web application integration, real-time facility monitoring, contactless payment processing, and data-driven member engagement strategies. Cloud-based solutions have become the industry standard, offering scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

Market research indicates a growing demand for integrated fitness management platforms that combine facility booking, member management, and health tracking capabilities. University fitness facilities particularly benefit from systems that integrate with existing student information systems and accommodate diverse user groups including students, staff, and community members. Technologies such as HTML for frontend development, Flask and MySQL for backend services, and AWS for cloud platforms can provide modern, scalable foundations for such systems.

**Target Audience:**
- Gym Users (students and staff): regular gym-goers, beginners who need guidance on fitness routines and calorie tracking, members of sports clubs, those who prefer off-peak hours
- Administrators: administrators who need tools to manage bookings and memberships

## Project Goals
The goal of the JCU Gym Management System project is to design and develop a modern, cloud-based web application that allows gym membership registration, payment processing, reservations, and user activity tracking. The proposed ICT solution will offer the following key features:

**Member Registration:**  

Users will be able to register as gym members through an intuitive online form. Secure authentication mechanisms will be implemented (and additionally for logging in and accessing personalised profiles). 

**Payment Processing:**  

The system will support multiple payment options, enabling users to make payments online via secure gateways or offline at designated locations. Transaction records will be stored securely for easy tracking.

**Session Booking:**  

Members will be able to browse gym sessions, view real-time availability, and make reservations accordingly. The system will provide automated scheduling and notification features to enhance user convenience.

**User Data Management:**  

The system will facilitate administrators in the efficient management of member records, ensuring data integrity and policy enforcement. Administrators will be able to access an interactive table to view member data, such as registration details and no-shows, and update the database as needed.

**Usage Tracking:**  

Administrators will have access to dedicated dashboards to visualise gym usage statistics, such as attendance and booking details. This feature will address current tracking difficulties, supporting operational efficiency.

**Database Usage:**  

The system will utilise MySQL as the backend database, providing a robust and secure foundation for storing user information, payment records, and reservation details. Data encryption and access controls will ensure the protection of sensitive information.

In conclusion, the JCU Gym Management System project aims to build a cloud-based web application that simplifies gym membership registration, payment processing, reservations, and activity tracking. By applying cloud-based technology, the system will ensure seamless user experiences, efficient administrative management, and data-driven decision-making, thereby enhancing the overall functionality of the gym services.
