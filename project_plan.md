# Iteration 1 Retrospective

## Completed Stories
- Secure Storage  
- Database schema with sample records  
- Flask-SQLAlchemy integration  
- Membership payment handling (offline)  
- Secure online registration â€“ form analysis (user roles, validation, compliance)

## Incomplete / In-Progress Stories

### Secure Online Registration
- Backend registration logic (hashing, email)  
- Frontend form validation and accessibility  
- Registration testing  

### Membership Payment Handling
- Online payment integration  
- Membership activation logic  
- Testing  

### Session Booking
- Entire task pending (backend logic, UI, notifications, testing)

## Lessons Learned
- **Team responsiveness and communication** need improvement. Some tasks were delayed due to late responses or a lack of updates from assigned members, which impacted dependent tasks and overall progress.  
- **Task ownership and accountability** need reinforcement. Some responsibilities were unclear or not followed through. In the next iteration, task assignment and expectations will be clearly defined and tracked.  
- **Frontend/backend alignment** requires earlier coordination, especially for form logic and validations. Early discussion and shared understanding will be prioritized moving forward.
